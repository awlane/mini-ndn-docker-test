Release Notes
=============

Mini-NDN version 0.7.0 (Major changes since version 0.6.0)
----------------------------------------------------------

**Breaking Changes**:

- Install behavior regarding existing installation of dependencies has been reversed; by default, these are now ignored. This is meant
  to clear up confusion regarding installing on existing installs which have been used for NDN development previously. The previous
  behavior can be enabled using `--use-existing`.

**New features**:

- Added `NFDCBatch` to NFDC helper, which allows the user to use the existing NFDC wrapper API to instead create and execute a batch file.
  When running large numbers of commands, this significantly speeds up performance due to not needing to add delay between individual CLI
  calls.
- Added `MinindnAdhoc` class which can be used to construct adhoc Mini-NDN-Wifi networks from topology files. 
- Model mobility parameters can now also be passed to Mini-NDN-Wifi via topology files.
- Working directory can be passed as constructor argument to `Minindn` objects
- We have added a new `--release` flag to the installer which simplifies installing matching releases of dependencies. Reference
  `the install documentation <./install.rst>`__ for more information.
- Experimental wifi support for NLSR helper. See `experiment docs <experiment>` for details (`issue: 5232 <https://redmine.named-data.net/issues/5232>`__)
- Added a Dockerfile for Mini-NDN. A prebuilt image for *linux/amd64* and *linux/arm64* platforms
  is available on the `GitHub container registry <https://github.com/named-data/mini-ndn/pkgs/container/mini-ndn>`__
- The previous testbed topology generation script has been deprecated and removed. Please reference the `NDN Play website <https://play.ndn.today/?testbed=1>`__
  for a replacement

**Improvements**:

- Ethernet unicast faces are now supported natively by NLSR wrapper, NFDC wrapper, and NDN routing helper. No additional formattinng by the user is needed
  for ethernet addresses extracted from the Mininet API when passed to these functions (`issue: 5321 <https://redmine.named-data.net/issues/5232>`__)
- `NdnRoutingHelper` has been parallelized along with minor optimizations. You can now also use it to create
  permanent faces (`issue: 5264 <https://redmine.named-data.net/issues/5264>`__)
- `checkConvergence` method of `Experiment` helper can now output more detailed information when flag `returnConvergenceInfo` is set
  (`issue: 5236 <https://redmine.named-data.net/issues/5236>`__)
- `getPopen` can now accept commands formatted as lists as well as strings
- We now natively edit nfd.conf files using infoconv to read and write it as json rather than calling infoedit at the shell
  (`issue: 5318 <https://redmine.named-data.net/issues/5318>`__)
- Added Sprint PoP topology
- Link bandwidth value (`bw`) can now be specified as decimal megabits rather than only integers in topology files
- NFDC was significantly refactored for the `NFDCBatch` change.

**Bug fixes**:

- NFDC helper properly supports existing faces and no longer outputs unnecessary error messages if face exists by default.
- Fixed out of date ndnsec commands
- Socket path now defaults to NFD default as of release 24.07. You can specify a different path with the `defaultSocketLocation` 
  argument in the `Nfd` object constructor (`issue: 5309 <https://redmine.named-data.net/issues/5309>`__)
- Fixed jitter being parsed into incorrect type from topology files
- Moved vestigial CLI arguments relating to `wifi_ping.py` example out of the Mini-NDN-Wifi class

emulate an NDN network on a single system.

**Included features**:

-  Run a complete NDN network on a single system

-  Automatic configuration of NLSR to provide a routable NDN network

-  Supports user created NDN applications

-  Create a topology using the included Mini-NDN Edit GUI application

-  Allows individual configuration of NFD and NLSR parameters for each
   node

-  Provides an experiment management framework for easy creation of
   custom networking experiments

-  Uses a simple topology file format to define hosts, links, and
   configuration values

-  Configure network link parameters including bandwidth, delay, and
   loss rate

-  Includes a pre-configured topology file to replicate the NDN testbed
